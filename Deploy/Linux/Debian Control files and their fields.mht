<H1>Debian Policy Manual <BR>Chapter 5 - Control files and their fields =
</H1>
<P>The package management system manipulates data represented in a =
common=20
format, known as <EM>control data</EM>, stored in <EM>control =
files</EM>.=20
Control files are used for source packages, binary packages and the=20
<CODE>.changes</CODE> files which control the installation of uploaded =
files[<A=20
href=3D"http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/footnotes.html#f31"=20
name=3Dfr31>31</A>]. </P>
<HR>

<H2><A name=3Ds-controlsyntax></A>5.1 Syntax of control files</H2>
<P>A control file consists of one or more paragraphs of fields[<A=20
href=3D"http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/footnotes.html#f32"=20
name=3Dfr32>32</A>]. The paragraphs are separated by empty lines. =
Parsers may=20
accept lines consisting solely of spaces and tabs as paragraph =
separators, but=20
control files should use empty lines. Some control files allow only one=20
paragraph; others allow several, in which case each paragraph usually =
refers to=20
a different package. (For example, in source packages, the first =
paragraph=20
refers to the source package, and later paragraphs refer to binary =
packages=20
generated from the source.) The ordering of the paragraphs in control =
files is=20
significant. </P>
<P>Each paragraph consists of a series of data fields. Each field =
consists of=20
the field name followed by a colon and then the data/value associated =
with that=20
field. The field name is composed of US-ASCII characters excluding =
control=20
characters, space, and colon (i.e., characters in the ranges 33-57 and =
59-126,=20
inclusive). Field names must not begin with the comment character,=20
<SAMP>#</SAMP>. </P>
<P>The field ends at the end of the line or at the end of the last =
continuation=20
line (see below). Horizontal whitespace (spaces and tabs) may occur =
immediately=20
before or after the value and is ignored there; it is conventional to =
put a=20
single space after the colon. For example, a field might be: </P><PRE>   =
  Package: libc6
</PRE>
<P>the field name is <SAMP>Package</SAMP> and the field value=20
<SAMP>libc6</SAMP>. </P>
<P>A paragraph must not contain more than one instance of a particular =
field=20
name. </P>
<P>There are three types of fields: </P>
<DL>
  <DT>simple</DT>
  <DD>
  <P>The field, including its value, must be a single line. Folding of =
the field=20
  is not permitted. This is the default field type if the definition of =
the=20
  field does not specify a different type. </P></DD></DL>
<DL>
  <DT>folded</DT>
  <DD>
  <P>The value of a folded field is a logical line that may span several =
lines.=20
  The lines after the first are called continuation lines and must start =
with a=20
  space or a tab. Whitespace, including any newlines, is not significant =
in the=20
  field values of folded fields.[<A=20
  href=3D"http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/footnotes.html#f33"=20
  name=3Dfr33>33</A>] </P></DD></DL>
<DL>
  <DT>multiline</DT>
  <DD>
  <P>The value of a multiline field may comprise multiple continuation =
lines.=20
  The first line of the value, the part on the same line as the field =
name,=20
  often has special significance or may have to be empty. Other lines =
are added=20
  following the same syntax as the continuation lines of the folded =
fields.=20
  Whitespace, including newlines, is significant in the values of =
multiline=20
  fields. </P></DD></DL>
<P>Whitespace must not appear inside names (of packages, architectures, =
files or=20
anything else) or version numbers, or between the characters of =
multi-character=20
version relationships. </P>
<P>The presence and purpose of a field, and the syntax of its value may =
differ=20
between types of control files. </P>
<P>Field names are not case-sensitive, but it is usual to capitalize the =
field=20
names using mixed case as shown below. Field values are case-sensitive =
unless=20
the description of the field says otherwise. </P>
<P>Paragraph separators (empty lines) and lines consisting only of =
spaces and=20
tabs are not allowed within field values or between fields. Empty lines =
in field=20
values are usually escaped by representing them by a space followed by a =
dot.=20
</P>
<P>Lines starting with # without any preceding whitespace are comments =
lines=20
that are only permitted in source package control files=20
(<CODE>debian/control</CODE>). These comment lines are ignored, even =
between two=20
continuation lines. They do not end logical lines. </P>
<P>All control files must be encoded in UTF-8. </P>
<HR>

<H2><A name=3Ds-sourcecontrolfiles></A>5.2 Source package control files =
--=20
<CODE>debian/control</CODE></H2>
<P>The <CODE>debian/control</CODE> file contains the most vital (and=20
version-independent) information about the source package and about the =
binary=20
packages it creates. </P>
<P>The first paragraph of the control file contains information about =
the source=20
package in general. The subsequent sets each describe a binary package =
that the=20
source tree builds. </P>
<P>The fields in the general paragraph (the first one, for the source =
package)=20
are: </P>

<P>The strings are compared from left to right. </P>
<P>First the initial part of each string consisting entirely of =
non-digit=20
characters is determined. These two parts (one of which may be empty) =
are=20
compared lexically. If a difference is found it is returned. The lexical =

comparison is a comparison of ASCII values modified so that all the =
letters sort=20
earlier than all the non-letters and so that a tilde sorts before =
anything, even=20
the end of a part. For example, the following parts are in sorted order =
from=20
earliest to latest: <SAMP>~~</SAMP>, <SAMP>~~a</SAMP>, <SAMP>~</SAMP>, =
the empty=20
part, <SAMP>a</SAMP>.[<A=20

name=3Dfr37>37</A>] </P>
<P>Then the initial part of the remainder of each string which consists =
entirely=20
of digit characters is determined. The numerical values of these two =
parts are=20
compared, and any difference found is returned as the result of the =
comparison.=20
For these purposes an empty string (which can only occur at the end of =
one or=20
both version strings being compared) counts as zero. </P>
<P>These two steps (comparing and removing initial non-digit strings and =
initial=20
digit strings) are repeated until a difference is found or both strings =
are=20
exhausted. </P>
<P>Note that the purpose of epochs is to allow us to leave behind =
mistakes in=20
version numbering, and to cope with situations where the version =
numbering=20
scheme changes. It is <EM>not</EM> intended to cope with version numbers =

containing strings of letters which the package management system cannot =

<P>Indicates that Debian Maintainers may upload this package to the =

<SAMP>DM-Upload-Allowed: yes</SAMP> is present in the source section of =
the=20
source control file of the most recent version of a package in unstable =

experimental, the Debian archive will accept uploads of this package =

the following fields is to indicate a publicly accessible repository =

  <P>The field name identifies the VCS. The field's value uses the =
version=20

locations and=20
  should be sufficient to locate the repository used for packaging. =
Ideally, it=20
  also locates the branch used for development of new versions of the =
Debian=20
  package. </P>
  <P>In the case of Git, the value consists of a URL, optionally =
followed by the=20
  word <SAMP>-b</SAMP> and the name of a branch in the indicated =
repository,=20
  following the syntax of the <SAMP>git clone</SAMP> command. If no =
branch is=20
  specified, the packaging should be on the default branch. </P>
  <P>More than one different VCS may be specified for the same package.=20

<H2><A name=3Ds5.7></A>5.7 User-defined fields</H2>
<P>Additional user-defined fields may be added to the source package =
control=20
file. Such fields will be ignored, and not copied to (for example) =
binary or=20
Debian source control files or upload control files. </P>
<P>If you wish to add additional unsupported fields to these output =
files you=20
should use the mechanism described here. </P>
<P>Fields in the main source control information file with names =
starting=20
<SAMP>X</SAMP>, followed by one or more of the letters <SAMP>BCS</SAMP> =
and a=20
hyphen <SAMP>-</SAMP>, will be copied to the output files. Only the part =
of the=20
field name after the hyphen will be used in the output file. Where the =
letter=20
<SAMP>B</SAMP> is used the field will appear in binary package control =
files,=20
where the letter <SAMP>S</SAMP> is used in Debian source control files =
and where=20
<SAMP>C</SAMP> is used in upload control (<SAMP>.changes</SAMP>) files. =

<P>For example, if the main source information control file contains the =
field=20
</P><PRE>       XBS-Comment: I stand between the candle and the star.
</PRE>
<P>then the binary and Debian source control files will contain the =
