Features:
---------

  -  The second circle drawn for occulted stars (having the meaning of tolerance) is confusing. Review the 'tolerance' usage and remove the circle
  -  The PSF Fit area numeric up down is not very useful. Review its usage and make it useful and working or remove it
  V) When the opened video frame size is too large, open it in 'shrinked' mode
  V) Add a Brightness/Contrast display mode. Could be very useful for 16 bit videos
  -  Add integration detection on the LightCurve form when applying binning, so the correct start/and integration period frames are identified

  - Run integration detection while the video is being measured. At the end before the light curve is shown, if the integration is consistent then:
     - Ask if the user wants to 'merge'all measurements for the same integration periods
	 - Ask for the camera model to apply instrumental delays (if the user has answered 'Ýes' to the above question)
  - Add integration detection on the LightCurve form with option of binning it

  - Make it possible to Zoom the main image with factors of 0.5 to 2.0.
  - Make it possible to vertical flip when doing photometry. In the more generic case - make it possible for all pre-processing (defects, flips, brightness/contrast etc) to be done before any operation
  - Make it possible to crop FITS files into smaller size frames
  - Make it possible to define a background area not in an annulus but in an arbitraty location
  - Add support for FITS cubes

  ?) Make it possible to select 2 locations on the light curve (the D and R datapoint) 
  ?) Make it possible to display both the D and R frame number and times on the LightCurve form  
  ?) Make it possible to measure in video fields
