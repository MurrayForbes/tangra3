<h4>Tangra Software Suite - Scienceware Open Source License</h4>

<h5>Copyright (c) 2012-2013, Hristo Pavlov</h5>

Ver 1.0, 19 Dec 2012

<pre>
This License applies to the TANGRA Software Suite, referred to below as software and/or TANGRA. It is a legal 
agreement between the licensee, addressed below as YOU, and the authors of TANGRA, including Hristo Pavlov 
(hristo_dpavlov@yahoo.com) and possibly others, referred to below as AUTHORS.

   This license governs the use of the TANGRA software including the running, copying, distribution, the compilation 
and modification of the source code. Your use of the software constitutes acceptance of this license.

   The TANGRA software has been created and is being distributed as free software for scientific use. The purpose of 
this license is to guarantee the scientific interests of the AUTHORS, allowing them to get credits for their work, 
without restricting YOU to use the software to obtain the best possible results. TANGRA is provided with the source 
code to allow full understanding of what it does and to ensure the scientific scrutiny of its quality.

   The AUTHORS take scientific responsibility for the content of TANGRA and you are not allowed to modify in any way 
the source code. If you find what you believe is a deficiency, you are allowed to propose a modification to the 
authors, who may or may not accept it. 

   You may install the software and its source code on a computer, compile the source code and run the software. You 
may use this software for non-commercial purposes, including making a reasonable number of copies. You are not allowed 
to modify and/or distribute modified versions of the software. 

   You may not use or distribute this software or any derivative works, including but not limited to output from the
software, in any form for commercial purposes. Examples of commercial purposes would be running business operations, 
licensing, leasing, or selling the software, distributing the software for use with commercial products or offering a
service for which there is any form of payment. If you wish to commercialize your work related to the software or take
part in research with industrial partners, you need to contact the AUTHORS to enquire about a commercial license.

   You may distribute snippets of this software in research papers and books, or publish snippets of the software on 
websites or on-line community forums that are intended for research, including research related to any results obtained
with the software. The total amount of source code in each of your snippets should not exceed 30 lines. If you wish to 
use a larger portion of the software, please contact the AUTHORS.

   You are free and encouraged to distribute the software for non-commercial purposes, but only as-is and without 
modifications. You may not grant rights to the software that are broader than those provided by this license. 

   Because TANGRA is intended for science, and its output should contain valid scientific results, both the source code 
and the output of the programs when run under well controlled conditions are open to scientific scrutiny, based upon a
rigorous application of the scientific method. You are entitled to complain about every inconsistency, programming and/or 
mathematical error, defect or inaccuracy contained in the source code and/or made apparent by the output. You are invited 
to report any such case to the AUTHORS, and they will do their best to maintain the scientific quality of the code and to
improve its reliability and performance. The AUTHORS give no guarantee when or if the reported issues will be corrected.

In return for the license rights above, you must agree to these obligations:

1. You will include a verbatim copy of this license if you distribute the software in any form.

2. Every publication, both on paper and electronic, including the posting on the World Wide Web and any other form 
   of distribution on the Internet and/or on any other medium, of results obtained with TANGRA with or without a 
   combination of other software, need to contain a credit statement recognizing the use of TANGRA. You should check
   with the AUTHORS if you are unsure what an appropriate format of the credit statement is. 

3. THE SOFTWARE COMES "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTIES. THIS MEANS NO EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING 
   WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY WARRANTY OF TITLE OR
   NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU MUST PASS THIS DISCLAIMER ON WHENEVER YOU DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE OR RESULTS OBTAINED BY THE
   SOFTWARE.

4. THE AUTHORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE OR THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT,
   SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT THE LAW PERMITS, NO MATTER WHAT LEGAL THEORY IT
   IS BASED ON. YOU MUST PASS THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY ON WHENEVER YOU DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE OR RESULTS OBTAINED 
   BY THE SOFTWARE.

5. Your rights under the license end immediately if you breach it in any way.

6. The AUTHORS reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this license.
